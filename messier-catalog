        <h2>About the Catalog</h2>
        <p>The Messier Catalog is a collection of 110 astronomical objects compiled by Charles Messier in the 18th century. Originally intended to help comet hunters avoid confusion, the list has become one of the most famous guides for amateur astronomers. It includes star clusters, nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky targets that are bright, beautiful, and accessible through small telescopes.</p>
